 * It may also be relevant to mention that several modern frameworks, such as the React+Redux combination, include FP ideas. For example, in React it's said that the view (whatever the user gets to see at a given moment) is a function of the current state. You use a function to compute what HTML and CSS must be produced at each moment, thinking in black box fashion.
