/* There's a final possibility you may want to consider: instead of JS, opt for Microsoft's TypeScript (at http://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of JS, compiled to JS5. The main advantage of TypeScript is adding (optional) static type checks to JS, which helps detect some programming errors at compile time. Beware: as with Babel or Traceur, not all of ES8 will be available.

You can also get type checks, without using TypeScript, by using Facebook's Flow (see https://flow.org/).
